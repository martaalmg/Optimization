    "The palace and fortress Alhambra in Granada is opening a new section that they have been restoring for the last 5 years. Before open it they want to plan every excursion and guide that is going to take place in those zones in order for the tourists to see all of the galleries available. They have calculated the price of each gallery, however they have also calculated the price of each path from the gallery to the rest, and after lots of studies they saw that they cannot have the same price for each of them because to go to some galleries they have to go through enormous beautiful gardens while other are just hallways that have no need of maintenance. They want to show the tourist all the galleries and expositions while getting the higher profit possible, which means going through the most beautiful paths.\n",
